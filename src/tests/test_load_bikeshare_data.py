Sorry, no tests here. I would have implemented this given more time. (check out my tests for other modules)
A common approach for this is creating test input files with just a couple of records,
or even mocking out the files inline (not recommended especially with binary files).
Another option is to mock out the dataframes, however that is not feasible here, as Spark doesn't like that.
(it can be done with Pandas for example)
